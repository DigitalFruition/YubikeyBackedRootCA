Below is a sample `USAGE.md` file, structured to guide users through setting up their own Certificate Authority environment based on the steps and configurations discussed. This file should be located in the root of your project directory and assumes the existence of other documents and scripts as referenced. Modify and expand upon it as necessary to fit the exact details and structure of your project.

# Usage Instructions

## Introduction

This document provides step-by-step instructions on setting up a Certificate Authority (CA) environment, replicating the setup for Digital Fruition, LLC's internal CA. It is designed to guide you through provisioning an air-gapped Certificate Authority using Debian Bullseye with Full Disk Encryption (FDE) and configuring the necessary components for both a Root and Intermediate CA.

For a detailed understanding of the project, its scope, and the architectural decisions, please refer to `README.md`.

## Prerequisites

Before proceeding, ensure that you have:

- Basic understanding of Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) and certificate management.
- Familiarity with Debian Linux and command-line interfaces.
- The necessary hardware to set up an air-gapped environment.

## Step 1: Provisioning the Air-gapped Machine

1. **Prepare a Debian Bullseye installation media** - Download the latest Debian Bullseye image from the official website and prepare a bootable USB or CD.

2. **Install Debian Bullseye with FDE**:
   - Boot from the installation media.
   - Follow the installation prompts.
   - When partitioning, select the option for Full Disk Encryption (FDE).
   - Complete the installation process and boot into your new system.

3. **Ensure Air-gap**:
   - Physically disconnect any network connections.
   - Avoid installing any unnecessary packages or services.

## Step 2: Execute Setup Scripts

1. **Prepare Scripts**:
   - Copy the scripts from the `scripts/setup` directory of this project into your air-gapped machine using a USB drive or similar means.

2. **Run Setup Scripts**:
   - Navigate to the directory containing the scripts.
   - Execute the scripts to install prerequisite packages and create necessary directories:

     ```bash
     cd /path/to/scripts/setup
     chmod +x *.sh  # Make sure the scripts are executable
     ./setup.sh     # Run the setup script
     ```

## Step 3: Prepare Configuration Files

1. **Copy OpenSSL Configuration Templates**:
   - Copy `root/openssl.config.template` and `intermediate/openssl.config.template` from the project directory to the respective directories in `/opt/ca/`.

2. **Edit Configuration Files**:
   - Navigate to `/opt/ca/root` and `/opt/ca/intermediate`.
   - Rename the copied template files to `openssl.cnf` or a similar name that you'll recognize.
   - Edit the configuration files according to your environment and needs:

     ```bash
     cd /opt/ca/root
     mv openssl.config.template openssl.cnf
     nano openssl.cnf  # or use any other text editor
     # Repeat for the intermediate configuration
     ```

   - Be sure to adjust paths, domain names, and other variables to fit your specific setup.

## Conclusion

Once you've completed these steps, you'll have an air-gapped CA environment with basic configurations for a Root and Intermediate CA. Continue with creating keys, signing certificates, and managing your CA as detailed in other documentation or guides specific to your CA's operational needs.

Remember, managing a CA, especially an air-gapped one, requires careful attention to security, backups, and procedures. Always ensure that your practices align with industry standards and your organizational security policies.
