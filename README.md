# YubikeyBackedRootCA
Instructions and templates to provision your own Root Certificate Authority using a Yubikey for private key storage

## Introduction

This project provides a framework and starting point for individuals or organizations looking to establish their own Certificate Authority (CA). By following the guidelines and utilizing the provided scripts and configuration files, users can create a robust, air-gapped CA suited for various purposes such as issuing certificates for web servers, creating internal intermediate CAs for secure communications, or any other scenario requiring a trusted certificate issuer.

## What is a Certificate Authority?

A Certificate Authority (CA) is a trusted entity responsible for issuing and managing digital certificates. Digital certificates are used to verify the identity of individuals, servers, or organizations online, facilitating secure communication and transactions over networks. The CA acts as a cornerstone of trust, ensuring that the entities holding certificates are who they claim to be.

## Why Create Your Own CA?

Establishing your own CA can be beneficial for:

- **Control and Trust**: Having your own CA allows you full control over the issuance and management of certificates within your organization or for your personal use.
- **Security**: For internal networks, private services, or testing environments where you need a trusted communication channel, a private CA can provide the necessary security without the need for external certificate providers.
- **Customization**: Tailor certificate policies, validity periods, and other aspects to fit specific needs or constraints of your environment or organization.

## Root CA vs. Intermediate CA

- **Root CA**: The topmost CA in a certificate chain, ultimately responsible for trust. The root CA's certificate is self-signed and must be protected rigorously, as compromise would affect the entire chain of trust.
- **Intermediate CA**: CAs that are subordinate to the root CA. Intermediate CAs are issued and managed by the root CA but can themselves issue certificates to end entities or other lower-level intermediates. Using intermediate CAs helps protect the root CA by limiting its exposure and usage.

## Why Use a YubiKey for the Root CA?

The root CA's private key is the most critical asset in your PKI. Compromise of this key would allow an attacker to issue fraudulent certificates, undermining the security of all communications trusted by the CA. A YubiKey is a hardware security module that stores cryptographic keys securely, providing:

- **Protection**: Keys can't be extracted from the device and are protected against physical and logical attacks.
- **Portability**: The YubiKey is small, durable, and easily portable, allowing for secure key usage across different machines.
- **Ease of Use**: Despite the strong security, Yubikeys are user-friendly and support various cryptographic operations needed for CA management.

## Getting Started

To start building your own CA using this project:

1. **Fork the Repository**: Visit the GitHub page for this project and fork the repository to your own account or organization.
2. **Clone and Setup**: Clone the forked repository to your local machine or to the air-gapped environment where you plan to set up the CA.
3. **Follow USAGE.md**: Open the `USAGE.md` file included in the repository for detailed instructions on provisioning the CA environment, setting up software, and configuring the Root and Intermediate CAs.

**Note**: This project and its documentation are starting points for creating a CA. It's crucial to understand the security implications and responsibilities involved in running a CA. Ensure all practices align with industry standards and organizational policies, and consider consulting with security professionals if necessary.
